# Simple Rounded Firefox Theme/CSS

A fork of **Khalylexe's Firefox-Rounded-Theme**, removing the enlarged border. Includes rounded tabs, search bar, popups, and other elements.
*I didn't do anything to the original code except remove the enlarged rounded borders.*

*Wallpaper art in the screenshot is by [@HyukHae_S on Twitter](https://x.com/HyukHae_Sj/status/1793475796889481330?failedScript=polyfills). Not included in this repo. You can set your own wallpaper by putting an image in the <code>chrome</code> folder titled <code>wallpaper.jpg</code>.*

## Steps to configure the theme
<ol>
   <li>Go to <code>about:config</code> and search for <code>toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets</code> and set it to <code>true</code>.</li>
   <li>Download the source code zip file from the <code>Releases</code> section.</li>
   <li>Unzip the file and copy the <code>chrome</code> folder into your Firefox profile directory. To find out the location of your profile directory go to <a href="https://github.com/Godiesc/floorp-one#example-of-aboutsupport"> about:support</a> or about:profiles.</li>
   <li>Restart the browser.</li>
</ol>

> [!TIP]
> Tested on **Floorp** browser, and looks very pretty on it. Vanilla Firefox should work great too though.
